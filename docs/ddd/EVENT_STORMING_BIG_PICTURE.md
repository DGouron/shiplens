# Event Storming Big Picture — Shiplens

*Created: 2026-04-04*
*Last updated: 2026-04-20 (cycle-themes frontend)*

## Overview

Shiplens is a team analytics tool connected to Linear. It synchronizes work data (issues, cycles, transitions), calculates sprint metrics, detects blockers, generates AI reports, and notifies via Slack.

The domain is split into **5 Bounded Contexts**:

| Bounded Context | Responsibility | Main Entities | Use Cases |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Identity** | Linear workspace connection (OAuth2, API Key) | LinearWorkspaceConnection | 5 |
| **Synchronization** | Import and update of Linear data | TeamSelection, SyncProgress, WebhookEvent | 7 |
| **Analytics** | Metrics, alerts, predictions, AI reports | CycleSnapshot, SprintReport, BlockedIssueAlert, StatusThreshold, BottleneckAnalysis, EstimationAccuracy, DurationPrediction | 18 |
| **Audit** | Team audit rules and Packmind integration | AuditRule, ChecklistItem, PackmindPractice | 3 |
| **Notification** | Slack notifications (reports, alerts) | SlackNotificationConfig, TeamAlertChannel | 4 |

## Bounded Context Relationships (Vaughn Vernon)

| Relationship | Pattern | Upstream (Supplier) | Downstream (Customer) | Mechanism |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Identity → Synchronization | **Customer-Supplier** | Identity | Synchronization | IdentityModule exports `LinearWorkspaceConnectionGateway` and `TokenEncryptionGateway`. SynchronizationModule imports them via NestJS DI. 4 out of 7 Sync usecases depend on these ports. |
| Synchronization → Analytics | **Published Language (via DB)** | Synchronization | Analytics | No code coupling. Analytics reads synchronized data directly via its own Prisma gateways. The database schema acts as the implicit contract. |
| Audit → Analytics | **Customer-Supplier** | Audit | Analytics | AuditModule exports 5 providers. AnalyticsModule imports AuditModule. `GenerateSprintReportUsecase` directly accesses Audit module internal files (relative import `../../audit/entities/...`). |
| Analytics → Notification | **Customer-Supplier** | Analytics | Notification | AnalyticsModule exports `SprintReportGateway`. NotificationModule imports AnalyticsModule to send reports on Slack. |
| Synchronization → Notification | **Published Language (via DB)** | Synchronization | Notification | Synchronized issue data feeds blocked issue alerts in Notification via Prisma gateways. |

## Shared Kernel

The Shared Kernel (`src/shared/`) provides cross-cutting technical abstractions:

| Layer | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `shared/foundation/` | `Usecase<P, R>`, `Presenter<I, O>`, `BusinessRuleViolation`, `ApplicationRuleViolation`, `GatewayError`, `createGuard()`, `EntityBuilder<P, E>` |
| `shared/domain/` | **Empty** — no shared business concepts yet |
| `shared/infrastructure/prisma/` | `PrismaService`, `PrismaModule` (global) |

The `shared/domain/` directory is empty. Types currently shared between BCs are shared via NestJS module exports, not through an explicit shared kernel. This is a point of attention: the `CycleMetrics` type (defined in Audit, built in Analytics) would be a good candidate for `shared/domain/`.

## Global Hot Spots (Pink)

| # | Problem | BC | Severity | Detail |
|---|----------|----|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Analytics module too large** | Analytics | high | 18 usecases, 7 entities, 15+ gateways. This BC does the work of 4-5 subdomains (Metrics, Reporting, Alerting, Estimation, Dashboard). Splitting would improve cohesion. |
| 2 | **Direct import Analytics → Audit** | Analytics/Audit | high | `GenerateSprintReportUsecase` imports internal files from the Audit module via a relative path (`../../audit/entities/...`). Violates BC boundary even though the NestJS module declares it. A port in Analytics or a type in `shared/domain/` would be cleaner. |
| 3 | **`CycleMetrics`: implicitly shared type** | Audit/Analytics | medium | Defined in Audit, built in Analytics. Natural candidate for `shared/domain/`. |
| 4 | **Heterogeneous persistence (filesystem vs Prisma)** | Audit, Analytics | medium | Audit rules and team settings use the filesystem. Everything else uses Prisma. Potential issue in multi-instance deployments. |
| 5 | **Two distinct Slack configs** | Notification | medium | `SlackNotificationConfig` (reports) and `TeamAlertChannel` (alerts) each have their own webhook. Potentially confusing configuration duplication. |
| 6 | **No automatic session refresh** | Identity | medium | The refresh token is not called automatically. Risk of unexpected `LinearSessionExpiredError`. |
| 7 | **`shared/domain/` is empty** | Global | low | No shared business concept is explicitly placed in the Shared Kernel. Shared types transit via NestJS module imports. |
| 8 | **In-memory theme cache** | Analytics | medium | `CycleThemeSetCacheInMemoryGateway` holds themes in a process-local `Map`. Restart-sensitive and not multi-instance safe. Move to Prisma / Redis before horizontal scale. |
| 9 | **AI errors modeled as `BusinessRuleViolation`** | Analytics | medium | `AiProviderUnavailableError extends BusinessRuleViolation` — so infrastructure unavailability maps to HTTP 422. The themes usecase catches it, but the pattern mis-classifies I/O failures as domain invariants. |
| 10 | **AI JSON parsing via greedy regex** | Analytics | medium | Both `GenerateSprintReport` and `DetectCycleThemes` parse AI output with `/\{[\s\S]*\}/`. Any wrapping prose with extra braces or nested JSON breaks the parser — throws a plain `Error`, surfaces as HTTP 500. |

## Addendum 2026-04-17 — Analytics BC

The Analytics BC now spans both workspaces with the same ubiquitous language. New elements worth surfacing in the global picture:

### New client-side domain events
- `TeamSelected` — user clicks a team card on the dashboard; the selected team becomes the anchor for all future right-side widgets (top projects/epics/assignees/themes).
- `TeamSelectionRestored` — dashboard mount reads the persisted selection from `localStorage` and applies it (with stale-fallback).

### New cross-BC relationship
- **Identity → Analytics (backend)** — `GetWorkspaceDashboardUsecase` now depends on `LinearWorkspaceConnectionGateway` to expose `workspaceId` in the dashboard DTO. Customer-Supplier pattern. Needed so the frontend can scope its `localStorage` key per workspace without an extra round-trip.

### New hot spot
- `useDashboard` carries two parallel selection states (`selectionOverride` + `persistedTeamId`). Works for one consumer; flagged to revisit when the second downstream widget (top cycle projects, etc.) lands.

### Glossary additions
- `Workspace-scoped persistence`, `Known statuses`, `Workflow status tag`, `Source badge` — see `docs/ddd/ubiquitous-language.md`.



## Addendum 2026-04-18 — Analytics BC (show-top-cycle-projects)

First widget of the dashboard right-side column shipped. It is intentionally a walking skeleton for 3 upcoming widgets (`show-top-cycle-epics`, `show-top-cycle-assignees`, `detect-cycle-themes-with-ai`).

### Walking-skeleton callout
- Shared shells extracted under `frontend/src/modules/analytics/interface-adapters/views/cycle-insight-shell/` (`cycle-insight-card`, `cycle-insight-metric-toggle`, `cycle-insight-ranking-row`, `cycle-insight-empty-state`) and `views/cycle-insight-drawer/` (`cycle-insight-drawer`, `cycle-insight-drawer-issue-row`).
- Shared hook `use-dismissable-overlay` placed in `frontend/src/shared/foundation/hooks/` (Escape + click-outside, listeners attached only when open) — reusable by the 3 upcoming widgets.
- **The shell API surface is now frozen.** Any change to the shared card / ranking-row / metric-toggle / drawer props will cascade to 3 future widgets. Treat it as a Published Language inside the BC.

### New cross-BC edge
- **Synchronization → Analytics (via DB, Published Language)** — `Issue.projectExternalId` was added (migration `20260417210416_add_issue_project_external_id`). Sync now imports `project { id }` from Linear GraphQL and propagates it through `IssueData` schema + webhook event schema + Prisma upsert. Analytics reads it via `TopCycleProjectsDataInPrismaGateway` to group cycle issues by project and to back the "No project" bucket (`projectExternalId IS NULL`). Still Published Language via DB — no code coupling between modules.

### New client-side domain events
- `TopCycleProjectsRequested` — widget mount / team switch triggers the ranking query (`useTopCycleProjects` resets `activeMetric`, `selectedProjectId`, `isExpanded` on `teamId` change).
- `CycleProjectIssuesDrawerOpened` — user clicks a ranking row; `selectedProjectId` flips from `null` and the issues query fires.
- `CycleProjectIssuesDrawerDismissed` — Escape, click-outside (via `use-dismissable-overlay`), or explicit close button resets `selectedProjectId` to `null`.

### Glossary additions
- `Top cycle projects`, `Right-side column`, `Show more affordance` — added in `docs/ddd/ubiquitous-language.md`.
- `Metric toggle`, `Drill-down drawer`, `No project bucket` — already present (seeded by `select-team-on-dashboard` in anticipation).


## Addendum 2026-04-18 — Analytics BC (detect-cycle-themes-with-ai)

Backend-only vertical shipped for AI-inferred theme detection on a team's active cycle. Frontend UI pending — when it lands, the widget will drop into the dashboard right-side column alongside `top cycle projects` / `top cycle assignees`.

### What shipped (backend only)
- `CycleThemeSet` entity with `isCachedWithin(nowIso, ttlMilliseconds)` TTL rule — Zod-validated (1 to 5 themes, name 1-60 chars, each theme with at least one issue external id).
- `DetectCycleThemesUsecase` orchestrates: active-cycle lookup → cache check (24h TTL) → live candidate-issue fetch → minimum-10-issues gate → workspace-language resolution → AI prompt build → AI call → JSON parse → `CycleThemeSet.create` → cache save → aggregate recomputation against the live snapshot.
- `GetCycleIssuesForThemeUsecase` for drill-down by theme name.
- Two presenters (`CycleThemesPresenter`, `CycleThemeIssuesPresenter`) returning discriminated unions that already anticipate the four UI states (`no_active_cycle` / `below_threshold` / `ai_unavailable` / `ready` for the ranking; `no_active_cycle` / `theme_not_found` / `ready` for the drawer).
- `CycleThemesController` with two endpoints: `GET /analytics/cycle-themes/:teamId?provider=&refresh=` and `GET /analytics/cycle-themes/:teamId/themes/:themeName/issues`.
- `CycleThemeSetDataInPrismaGateway` (Cycle / Issue / Label / StateTransition reads — per-issue cycle time computed from the `started` + `completed` transitions).
- `CycleThemeSetCacheInMemoryGateway` — process-local `Map` (intentional YAGNI, flagged in hot spots).

### No new cross-BC edge
Reuses pre-existing ports: `AiTextGeneratorGateway`, `WorkspaceSettingsGateway`. No new module imports, no new Prisma models, no Synchronization coupling beyond the already-published DB language.

### New domain events (6)
- `CycleThemesRequested` — controller invokes `DetectCycleThemes`.
- `CycleThemesServedFromCache` — cached `CycleThemeSet` is fresh (<24h); AI is skipped.
- `CycleThemesRefreshed` — AI runs; a new `CycleThemeSet` is persisted.
- `CycleThemeDetectionBelowThreshold` — fewer than 10 candidate issues; AI never called.
- `AiProviderUnavailableForThemes` — `AiProviderUnavailableError` caught; cache not touched.
- `CycleThemeDrillDownOpened` — drawer consumer resolves a theme's issues.

### New business rules (6)
See the inventory above (`CycleThemeMinimumIssueThreshold`, `CycleThemeCacheTtl`, `CycleThemeManualRefreshInvalidatesCache`, `CycleThemeLanguageMirrorsWorkspace`, `CycleThemeAggregationScopedToCurrentIssues`, `AiUnavailableNeverPoisonsCache`).

### Glossary additions
- `Manual refresh`, `Theme aggregate`, `Candidate issue (themes)`, `AI provider unavailable (themes)`, `Below threshold (themes)` — new in `docs/ddd/ubiquitous-language.md`.
- `Cycle theme`, `Theme cache` — pre-seeded entries refined to cite the actual implementation (`CycleThemeSetCacheInMemoryGateway`, `generatedAt`).

### Flagged hot spots
- In-memory cache not multi-instance safe (restart wipes all teams' themes).
- `AiProviderUnavailableError` as `BusinessRuleViolation` — mis-classifies infrastructure errors as domain invariants.
- `InsufficientIssuesForThemeDetectionError` declared but never thrown — dead code or inconsistent refusal pattern.
- Fragile AI JSON parsing shared with `GenerateSprintReport`.
- Theme NAME is the drill-down URL segment — fragile across renames and non-ASCII.

|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 2026-04-04 | Global audit | 5 BCs (Identity, Synchronization, Analytics, Audit, Notification) | Event Storming Big Picture |
| 2026-04-17 | Target | Analytics BC re-audit — front + back unified, team-selection feature, workflow-config UI, dashboard `workspaceId` | Event Storming (analytics) |
| 2026-04-18 | Target | Analytics BC addendum — show-top-cycle-projects walking skeleton (right-side column, shared shells + drawer + `use-dismissable-overlay`), Sync `Issue.projectExternalId` cross-BC edge, 3 new client-side events | Event Storming (analytics) |
| 2026-04-18 | Target | Analytics BC addendum — detect-cycle-themes-with-ai backend vertical (`CycleThemeSet` + 24h TTL, `DetectCycleThemes` / `GetCycleIssuesForTheme` usecases, two presenters + controller, in-memory cache), 6 new domain events, 6 new rules, no new cross-BC edge, frontend pending | Event Storming (analytics) |

## Addendum 2026-04-20 — Analytics BC (detect-cycle-themes-with-ai frontend landed)

The backend vertical shipped on 2026-04-18 now has its frontend counterpart. Previously the global picture carried a pending note ("frontend UI pending") — this addendum closes that loop and records the new client-side events and rules surfaced by the React layer.

### What shipped (frontend only — backend unchanged)

- `TopCycleThemes` gateway port + response schemas mirroring the backend's 4-variant ranking DTO and 3-variant drawer DTO (Zod discriminated unions).
- `TopCycleThemesInHttpGateway` with optional `?refresh=true&provider=...` query params, URL built via the `top-cycle-themes.url-contract.ts` constant (Published Language rule).
- `GetTopCycleThemesUsecase` + `ListCycleThemeIssuesUsecase` registered in `frontend/src/main/dependencies.ts`.
- `TopCycleThemesPresenter` (ranking ViewModel — 4 backend statuses → 5 semantic booleans + `emptyTone` `neutral` / `warning`, client-side metric re-sort, top-5 slice) + `CycleThemeIssuesDrawerPresenter` (4-state drawer VM).
- `useTopCycleThemes` hook — React Query with a `forceRefreshToken` counter threaded through the query key, `cardTitle` exposed separately, state reset (`activeMetric`, `selectedThemeName`, `forceRefreshToken`) on `teamId` change.
- 6 humble views under `frontend/src/modules/analytics/interface-adapters/views/top-cycle-themes/` (section, ready, loading, error, drawer, refresh-button).
- Mounted as the third card of the dashboard right-side column in `DashboardView` (l.124), below `TopCycleAssigneesSectionView`.

### Decision change recorded

- **AI unavailable ≠ card hidden** — the original spec said the card should be hidden when the AI provider is down. The shipped implementation keeps the card visible with an amber warning tone and an active refresh button. The shift is captured in the `AiUnavailableCardRemainsVisible` rule on `analytics.md` and in the new `AI unavailable card` glossary entry. Rationale: one-click retry without leaving the dashboard.

### New client-side domain events (4)

| # | Event | BC | Type |
|---|-------|----|------|
| 43 | TopCycleThemesRequested (client-side) | Analytics | UX |
| 44 | ManualCycleThemesRefreshInvoked (client-side) | Analytics | UX |
| 45 | CycleThemeIssuesDrawerOpened (client-side) | Analytics | UX |
| 46 | CycleThemeIssuesDrawerDismissed (client-side) | Analytics | UX |

> `ManualCycleThemesRefreshInvoked` is the browser-local counterpart of the backend `CycleThemesRefreshed` — the former fires before the HTTP call, the latter inside the usecase execution.

### New business/presentation rules (frontend)

| # | Rule | BC | Severity |
|---|------|----|----------|
| 30 | FourThemeStatusesMapToFiveFlags | Analytics | presentation |
| 31 | AiUnavailableCardRemainsVisible | Analytics | UX (decision change vs. spec) |
| 32 | ThemeMetricClientSideSort | Analytics | presentation |
| 33 | ManualRefreshViaCounterToken | Analytics | UX |
| 34 | ThemesHookStateResetOnTeamSwitch | Analytics | UX |
| 35 | CardTitleExposedSeparately | Analytics | presentation (debt — divergent from assignee/project widgets) |

### No new cross-BC edge

The frontend widget consumes only pre-existing HTTP endpoints (`GET /analytics/cycle-themes/:teamId` + drill-down). No new module imports, no new backend dependency. The relation is the same `Customer-Supplier via Published Language (HTTP)` edge already noted between the two Analytics sides.

### Hot spot resolved

- **"No frontend projection yet"** for cycle themes (flagged on 2026-04-18) — **RESOLVED**.

### New hot spots (frontend)

| # | Problem | BC | Severity | Detail |
|---|----------|----|----------|--------|
| 11 | **Theme name as drill-down URL segment (frontend-exposed)** | Analytics | medium | The frontend now calls `GET /analytics/cycle-themes/:teamId/themes/:themeName/issues` with the AI-generated theme name as a path segment. `topCycleThemesPaths.themeIssues` uses `encodeURIComponent` — safe today, but any server-side / proxy-level Unicode normalization (case folding, NFC vs NFD) would break the exact-name lookup. A stable theme id would eliminate the whole class of issue. |
| 12 | **`forceRefreshToken` counter inflates the React Query key-space** | Analytics | low | Every refresh creates a NEW cache entry (key includes the token). The hook manually calls `removeQueries` to garbage-collect. If a future consumer forgets the remove step, memory grows monotonically per refresh click. |
| 13 | **`cardTitle` exposed outside the ViewModel** | Analytics | low | Divergent from the assignee/project widgets. Rationale today: the shell renders the title during loading/error/no-active-cycle states, but the ViewModel only exists in `ready`. Consistency debt worth reconciling across the three widgets. |

### Glossary additions

- `Manual cycle themes refresh`, `Top cycle themes`, `Theme ranking row`, `Cycle theme issues drawer`, `AI unavailable card`, `Force refresh token` — see `docs/ddd/ubiquitous-language.md`.
